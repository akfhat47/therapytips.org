        content: "In some relationships, it can be hard to tell where love ends and codependency begins. A loving relationship feels like safety and warmth—a space where you can be yourself, have tough conversations without fear and feel valued for who you are, rather than how much you can give someone else.</P>\n<P>Codependency, on the other hand, feels like walking on eggshells in a relationship—constantly second-guessing every interaction, seeking approval and living in fear that a single misstep could cause everything to unravel.</P>\n<P>According to a 2018 <A title=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-018-9983-8\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-018-9983-8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">study</A> published in the <EM>International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</EM>, codependency is a complex and multifaceted psychosocial problem. It manifests as three interconnected experiences:</P>\n<UL>\n<LI><STRONG>A lack of a clear sense of self</STRONG>, where individuals struggle to define their identity outside of relationships.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>Extreme emotional imbalance</STRONG>, characterized by enduring cycles of instability in various spheres of life, including one&#39;s personal life, relationships and occupation.</LI>\n<LI><STRONG>Lasting effects of childhood experiences</STRONG>, with issues of parental abandonment and control shaping current relational dynamics.</LI>\n</UL>\n<P>Building on these insights, here are four common types of codependent dynamics that illustrate how these patterns can play out in relationships:</P>\n<H3>1. The Enabler And The Transgressor</H3>\n<P>In this codependent dynamic, the &quot;enabler&quot; is the person who often believes, &quot;I can fix them if I love them enough.&quot; This misguided sense of duty drives them to overlook harmful behaviors, such as substance abuse or emotional outbursts, in an attempt to save the relationship. Struggling to set boundaries, they excuse their partner&#39;s actions repeatedly, while sacrificing their own well-being.</P>\n<P>For instance, one partner&#39;s occasional drinking might escalate into a dependency over time. Despite repeated promises such as &quot;I&#39;ll change&quot; or &quot;This was the last time,&quot; the behavior persists, leading to constant arguments and chaos. The enabler, desperate to avoid conflict and keep the peace, forgives the &quot;transgressor&quot; each time, even though both know the cycle will repeat. This creates a vicious cycle where neither partner grows or heals.</P>\n<H3>2. The Dominant And The Submissive</H3>\n<P>Contrary to how they appear on the outside, &quot;dominant&quot; partners are often driven by fear and a need for security. To feel safe, they seek to manage and control their partner&#39;s behaviors, struggling with uncertainty and often finding it difficult to trust their partner&#39;s decisions. This need for control stems from deep-seated anxiety and an inability to let go.</P>\n<P>In contrast, the &quot;submissive&quot; partner complies to avoid conflict or abandonment, suppressing their needs and desires to maintain peace. Over time, this dynamic creates a destructive loop, with the dominant partner tightening their grip and the submissive losing their sense of self.</P>\n<P>As Selma, a participant from the 2018 study explains, &quot;It is like the chameleon, you know, trying to fit in with every situation rather than allowing myself to be who I am.&quot; This highlights the submissive&#39;s tendency to bend to their partner&#39;s needs, eroding their sense of self and leaving them feeling frustrated, lost and trapped in the relationship.</P>\n<P>For instance, imagine a relationship where one partner dictates what their significant other can wear, who they can meet or how they spend their time. The submissive might think, &quot;They just care about me,&quot; while suppressing their frustration. Meanwhile, their partner&#39;s inability to let go fuels a cycle of constant control, leaving both feeling unfulfilled.</P>\n<P>A 2022 <A title=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605221117158\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605221117158\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">study</A> published in the <EM>Journal of Interpersonal Violence</EM> reveals the early roots of this dominant-submissive dynamic. Researchers found that higher levels of parental psychological control during childhood are associated with unbalanced power dynamics in adult relationships, while individuals with a stronger belief in their ability to maintain relationships find themselves in more balanced partnerships.",
